 Configuration
===============

The QA would run basically on the command-line only with the specification of
the target(s) to be checked. However, using options and gathering these
in conf-files facilitates checks.

Configuration options follow a specific syntax with case-insensitive
option names (e.g. kEy-WorD).

.. code-block:: bash

  KEY-WORD                             enable key-word; equivalent to key-word=t
  KEY-WORD   =     value[,value ...]   assign key-word a [comma-separated] value; overwrite
  KEY-WORD   +=    value[,value ...]   same, but appended


Partitioning of Data Sets
-------------------------

The specification of a path to a data directory tree by option ``PROJECT_DATA``
results in a check of every NetCDF files found within the entire tree.
This can be further customised by the key-words ``SELECT`` and ``LOCK``,
which follow special rules.

.. code-block:: bash

  KEY-WORD                            var1[,var2,...]   specified variables for every path; += mode
  KEY-WORD      path1[,path2,...] [=]                   all variables within the specified path; +=mode
  KEY-WORD      path1[,path2,...]  =  [var1[,var2,...]  specified variables within the given paths; += mode
  KEY-WORD  =   path1[,path2,...]  =  [var1[,var2,...]  same, but overwrite mode
  KEY-WORD  +=  path1[,path2,...]  =  [var1[,var2,...]  append to a previous assignment


Some options act on other options:

- Options on the command-line have to be prefixed by '-E\_'.

- Highest precedence for options on the command-line.

- If path has no leading '/', then the search is relative to the path specified
  by option PROJECT_DATA.

- Special for options ``-S arg`` or an appended plain string on the command-line:
  cancellation of previous SELECTions in any configuration file.

- If SELECTions are specified on the command-line (options -S) with an absolute
  path, i.e. beginning with '/', then PROJECT_DATA specified in any
  config-file is cancelled..

- All selections refer to atomic variables, i.e. all
  sub-temporal files, even if a file name is appended to a path.

- LOCKing gets the higher precedence over SELECTion.

- Path and variable indicators are separated by the '=' character, which may be
  omitted when there is no variable (except the case that the path item
  contains no '/' character).

- Regular expressions may be applied to both path(s) and variable(s).

- A variable is selected if the beginning of the name is unambigous,
  e.g. specifying 'tas' would select all tas, tasmax, and tasmin files.
  Note that every file name begins with ``variable_...`` for CMIP5/CORDEX, thus,
  use ``tas_`` for this alone.


Configuration Files
===================

A description of the configuration options is given in the repository.

.. code-block:: bash

    QA-DKRZ:
    /package-path/tables/projects/"project-name"/"project-name"_qa.conf

Configuration files and options may be specified multiply following a given
precedence. This facilitates to have a file with short-term options (in a
file attached to the -f option on the command-line), another one with settings
to site-specific demands, which are robust against changes in the repository,
and long-term default settings from the repository. All options may be specified
on the command-line plus some more (
``/package-path/QA-DKRZ/scripts/qa_DKRZ --help``).
A sequence of configuration files is defined by ``QA_CONF=conf-file``
assignments embedded in the configuration files.
The precedence of configuration files/options is given below from highest to
lowest:

-  directly on the command-line
-  in the task-file (``-f file``) specified on the command-line.
-  QA_CONF assignments embedded (descending starts from the ``-f file``).
-  site-specific files provided by files located straight in
   ``/package-path/tables``.
-  defaults for the entire project:


Experiment Names
================

QA-DKRZ checks files individually, the results are gathered in containers
unique for a specific scope. Albeit most projects have defined a term
'experiment', this is not suitable to provide a realm common to a sub-set
of data files. Note that having everything identical, but the model for instance
could cause annotations, i.e. differences for some variables,
in the QA results.

For CMIP5 and CORDEX, an unambiguous scope is defined by the properties of
the so-called Data Reference System, i.e. the components of the path to
the variables. The option ``EXP_PATH_INDEX`` together with option
``EXP_PATH_BASE``
defines a unique experiment-name, where the former contains a comma-separated list
of indices of the path components and the latter the starting component with
index=0, e.g. ``EXP_PATH_BASE=output`` and ``EXP_PATH_INDEX=1,2,3,4,6``.
An example is commented in :ref:`results`.

.. note:: If ``EXP_PATH_INDEX`` is not set, then consistency checks are disabled.
