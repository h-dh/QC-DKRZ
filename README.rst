:Version: 0.5.x

The QA tool is a quality assurance checker for metadata in climate data (NetCDF files). The tool checks
the `CF-Conventions`_ conformance (Climate and Forecast Conventions) and also projects conventions for CMIP5 and CORDEX.

.. note:: The QA tool is still in a testing stage.

.. _`CF-conventions`: http://cfconventions.org/

Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to install the QA tool is to use the conda package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ conda install -c birdhouse qa-dkrz

See :ref:`installation` for details and how to install from source. 

You can now run for example the CF-checker on a NetCDF file:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dkrz-cf-checker -h
   $ dkrz-cf-checker my_tasmax.nc

See more :ref:`examples` to get started.
