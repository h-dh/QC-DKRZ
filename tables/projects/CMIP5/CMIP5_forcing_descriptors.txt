Nat
natural forcing (a combination, not explicitly defined here, that might include, for example, solar and volcanic)

LU
land-use change

Ant
anthropogenic forcing (a mixture, not explicitly defined here, that might include, for example, well-mixed greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land-use changes).

Sl
solar irradiance (note: Sl is "S" followed by a lower case "L", not an upper case "I")

GHG
well-mixed greenhouse gases (a mixture, not explicitly defined here)

Vl
volcanic aerosol (note: Vl is "V" followed by a lower case "L", not an upper case "I")

SD
anthropogenic sulfate aerosol, accounting only for direct effects

SS
sea salt

SI
anthropogenic sulfate aerosol, accounting only for indirect effects

Ds
Dust

SA
(SD + SI) anthropogenic sulfate aerosol direct and indirect effects

BC
black carbon

TO
tropospheric ozone

MD
mineral dust

SO
stratospheric ozone
OC
organic carbon

Oz
(TO+SO) ozone (= tropospheric and stratospheric ozone)

AA
anthropogenic aerosols (a mixture of aerosols, not explicitly defined here

N/A
no forcing
