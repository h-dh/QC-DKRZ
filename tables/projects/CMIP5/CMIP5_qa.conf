# Detailed explanation of syntax rules at the end of this file.

# Section: Customisation
# ----------------------

# Path to the root of directory tree(s) with netCDF data files.
# Note: the contained sub-directory tree(s) are appended to QA_RESULTS.
# Note: this option is mandatory.
# PROJECT_DATA=/work/ik0555/cordex/archive/CORDEX

# Path to QA results and logs.
# Note that results will be inegrated into the QA repository by default
# (not recommended).
# QA_RESULTS=/work/bm0021/hdh/QA_results/CORDEX/CCLM

# Selection of paths and variables (RegExp of the 'expr' command,
# i.e. full specification from the beginning of the word).
# Paths and variables are given by '[path1[,path2,..]][=][var1[,var2,..]]'.
# 1) The '=' character is required when both path and variable items are specified.
#    It is also required for paths without any '/'.
# 2) Omission of path components selects variables in all sub-paths
#    cointained in PROJECT_DATA.
# 3) Omission of variable component(s) selects all variables in the path(s).
# 4) By default, all files in PROJECT_DATA (and sub-trees) are selected.
# Full syntax rules and examples  at the end of this file.
# SELECT path=var
# SELECT AFR-44/CLMcom/MPI-ESM-LR/historical/r1i1p1/CCLM4-8-17

# Locking of variables (takes precedence over SELECT).
# See SELECT for a description.
# LOCK .*/Z=   # [disabled]

# Purpose: If the QA package is installed on a file system
# accessed by machines of different architectures and if more than one
# is dedicated to run the QA, then these
# require different names for the directories
# of residing executables. By default: QA-DKRZ/bin . The
# bin-directories must have been specified during the installation process.
# If the path is relative, the directory has to be a sub-dir of QA-DKRZ.
# If directories are prefixed by the hostname(s) of computer(s) separated
# by ':' from the directory, then multiple directories may be specified
# as comma-separated-list. The name(s) of the computer(s) must be
# available in the list of hosts, i.e. QA_EXEC_HOSTS. A name without a prefix
# is dedicated for the host on which qcManager is running (but could also
# have a prefix).
# You have to compile all executables into all bin-directories specified.
# QA_BIN=bin  # surge:bin,another-host:bin2 #[bin]

# The package is up-dated by default each time qcManager is started.
# If a particular version should be kept ,
# then option ALWAYS_UPDTAE=disable would accomplish this.
# ALWAYS_UPDATE=disable #[enable]


# Section: Files and Tables
# -------------------------

# This option controls whether the second time-stamp in the filename
# expresses the sharp end (deadline) of the period or whether the
# most frequent componente of the period in the stamp has to be extended to the end,
# e.g. 2000-03 <=> 2000-03-31 for extended.
# The difference is explained best by examples.
# 1) Sharp:     2000 - 2001 <=> 2000-01-01T00:00:00 - 2001-01-01T00:00:00
# 2) Extended:  2000 - 2001 <=> 2000-01-01T00:00:00 - 2001-12-31T24:00:00
# If there is a mix for the components of the stamps, then use this
# Syntax: 'Yx-Mx-Dx-hx-mx-sx' with x=s or x=e for sharp and extended
# respectively. APPLY_MAXIMUM_DATE_RANGE without any assignment enables 'extended' for
# the date and sharp for the time component.

# in the directory tree of the QA results, too. Enable this option if
# symbolic links are to be dereferenced, i.e. genuine data are to
# replace the symbolic links in the QA result tree.
# DEREFERENCE_SYM_LINKS # [disabled]

# If distributed computing is also involved with distributed file system,
# then enable this option. Bi-directional communication and data
# transfer is done by ssh and scp, respectively. IMPORTANT NOTE: this is
# not installed and not projected for CMIP5 or CORDEX.
# But, the QA may have anyway distributed computing with a shared file system.
# DISTRIBUTED_FS # [disabled]

# The purpose of an experiment-like name is just to tag a larger set of various
# checks with a name that corresponds to a certain volume of netCDF files.
# There are several ways to define EXP_NAME: explicite string, respresenting
# a path to a file ensemble, a pattern of data file names, and
# 'all-scope' by default (precedence as here).

# Explicit experiment-like name.
# EXP_NAME=string  # [disabled]

# Experiment-like name representing a group of files with common filename pattern.
# Syntax: EXP_FNAME_PATTERN=bi[/ej][/s=char] with numbers i and j,
# with separator s='_c' by default, begin of the pattern at the i-th occurrence
# of s and the end just before the j-th occurrence (to the end of the filename
# by default). Note that a date or a date range appended to the filename is always
# excluded. Note: if any versioning is done in the path but not in the filename,
# then EXP_PATH_INDEX should be preferred.
# EXP_FNAME_PATTERN=b1   # [disabled]

# The directory in the path at which counting starts for the indices
# of EXP_PATH_INDEX. Note that the first occurrence from left is taken. If there
# are more than a single instance with the same name, and the second one for
# instance is targeted, then append ':2'. Note that this is case-sensitive.
  EXP_PATH_BASE=cmip5:2 # [the directory in the path with index=0 ]

# Based on EXP_PATH_BASE, EXP_NAME is constructed by path components whose indeces
# are provided by EXP_PATH_INDEX, a comma-separated sequence with index==0
# for EXP_PATH_BASE.
# Note that the example provides index in [], which are not part of the name.
# For instance, the sequence 1,4,2,3,5 applied to the path
# /base[0]/AFR-44[1]/SMHI[2]/CCCma-CanESM2[3]/historical[4]/r1i1p1[5]/SMHI-RCA4[6]/v1[7]/day[8]/clh[9]
# results in AFR-44_historical_SMHI_CCCma-CanESM2_r1i1p1.
# Note: if any versioning is done in the filename but not in the path,
# then EXP_FNAME_PATTERN should be preferred.
# If EXP_PATH_INDEX remains disabled, then consistency checks are disabled, too.
  EXP_PATH_INDEX=0,1,2,3,7 # [disabled]

# By default, paths to data are found ignoring hidden directories.
# HIDDEN_DIRECTORY_DESCENT

# Skip broken links in the directory tree of data,
# i.e. files pointing to a non-existing target.
# By default, a warning is issued.
# IGNORE_BROKEN_LINKS

# Occurrences rising a notification of level L>2 cause the
# creation of a qc_lock_<filename>.txt file, which will prevent
# any further checking of files of the given variable.
# This option ignores any blocking of following temporal subsets.
# Note: In case that a blocking file was found
# but no qc_<filename>.nc file, then the blocking holds anyway.
# IGNORE_LOCK_FILES

# Standard and project tables are used to check consistency and
# continuity of parted atomic-data sets and experiments.
# Each sub-temporal file will be checked against the project table.
# The assignment will be prefixed to the string indicated by
# PT_PATH_INDEX. If the latter is not specified, then prefix is
# the name of the project table.
  PROJECT_TABLE_PREFIX=pt

# Purpose: automatic determination of the project table name.
# Usage is the same as for EXP_PATH_INDEX.
# Note that meta-data of each file will be checked against the project table.
# So, components representing a different layout explicitely,
# e.g. different driving-models (index 7) could have different calendars.
# Note that the example provides index in [], which are not part of the name.

# By default, the QA examines the begin and end dates specified
# by the time records of all sub-temporal files and finds
# by synchronisation the right file for proceeding
# (or starting) a check. The purpose of this option:
# a) check the times in the filenames as well as in the files and
#    search for overlapping periods in the set of sub-temporal files
#    of a given variable.
# b) check the modification times of the sub-temporal files of a given
#    variable. Issue a warning, if the modification time of the set of
#    the sorted files according to a) is not ascending.
#    This is disabled by assigning 'no_mod'.
# c) ignore filename embedded times by assigning 'mixed' (csl accepted)

# By default, the record of time is tested on the basis of regular
# steps and for consistency across files and experiments. However
# the entire set of CMIP5 experiments includes also irregularities
# and distinct periods. Time information was extracted from the
# CMIP5 standard table and is given in QA/tables/time_table.csv
# which provides a default. Please have a copy of your own with a
# different name in case of individual settings; the file
# 'time_table.csv' is part of svn updates. Please have a very close
# look at the file, because this table is certainly not free of errors.
# If you detect any, please give a short note.

# Section: Command-line used Options
# ----------------------------------

# Remove former results corresponding to the paths and variables
# selected before re-doing the QA. However, corresponding logfiles

# 2) CLEAR=lock for files qc_lock_<filename>.txt .
# 3) CLEAR=note for qc_note_<filename>.txt.
# 4) CLEAR='resume', then qc_lock_<filename>.txt files will
#    be removed before processing any further.
# 5) CLEAR=follow_links. When targets are pointed to
#    by symbolic links, then both target and link will be removed.
#    Note: symbolic links are removed by default, but not the targets.
# 6) CLEAR=mark, when a file 'clear.mark' or a file
#    <filename_root>.clear is present.
# Multiple options by a comma-separated-list; the order doesn't matter.
# Note: CLEAR=lock,note or mark enables option FORCE_STND_TABLE for the respective variable.

# Section: Miscellaneous
# ---------------------

# By default, calculation of cell averages over a geographical grid is
# performed by weighting with the corresponding grid-cell area. In
# particular for ocean basin cross-section, this is very time consuming
# due to the irregular shape of the basins taken into account by
# varying filling values (also for regular grids with varying effective
# areas, e.g. T of snow). If the precise value of the average is less
# important, this option reduces calculation time.
  ARITHMETIC_MEAN  # [disabled]

# The QA checks meta data, time data and data (of variables), where
# for the latter two the records are inspected.
# Modes can be enabled by key-words: meta, time, data.
# Note: data includes meta and time; time includes meta.
# CHECK_MODE=time  #[data]

# Calculate checksum of every file that passes successfully the QA.
# If md5 or sha1 are assigned, then a separate text file is generated
# where the checksum is stored with appended extension md5 or sha1
# respectively, to the filename, i.e. filename.nc.md5.
# Else, a named script/program is executed.
# Such a script/program must be available in the user's search path for
# commands or the path has to be absolute.
# The function is not part of the QA package. The calling qcExecutor
# script provides the following parameters:
#  1) filename
#  2) path to the root of the CMIP5 directory tree
#  3) path to the data file in the CMIP5 directory tree
#  4) path to the session-log file
#  5) name of the experiment as defined by EXP_PATH_INDEX
# If the script/program outputs two elements to standard output
# (suppose: filename and a kind-of-checksum), then these are written
# to a table in the project path named according to the
# experiment-log-name prefixed by 'cs_'.

# Section: Frequency Distribution
# -------------------------------
# Please, note thath this was not tested for a rather long time.

# Calculate the frequency distribution of the entire domain
# Note: generally, you will need post-processing with 'hist.x' to
# assemble the final frequency distribution, except you select specific
# debug options.
# Rules for selecting class widths and starting point (e.g. centering):
# Firstly, a fd-build-file of the same variable at destination has precedence.
# Second choice is a fd-build-file or fd-prop-file (the header of
# a build-file) in a specified path.
# Thirdly, explicit statement of properties.
# Default: automatic determination of fd properties.
# FREQ_DIST  # [disabled]

# Partitioning the total time span of an experiment into
# smaller ranges. FreqDists will be calculated separately for each
# window. Note: the residual time interval may be shorter.
# Note: if no unit-designator is appended (y, mo, d, h, mi, s)
# the unit from the time variable is used.
# FD_TIME_PART=5y # 30y [ default: the entire experiment]

# By default, frequency distributions adjust automatically the bin (class) width
# while processing the first time window (or the total time span),
# which is then used in subsequent time windows for the entire experiment.
# Specifying this path enables to retain the properties of the same
# variable (if found) of another experiment, e.g. control run.
# Such a file must have extension .build or .prop
# FD_PROPERTY_PATH=  # [no path]

# Explicit properties (two quantities separated by '/'):
#    class-width (number) / init value (number),
# e.g. 1/0 will centre a bin (class) of the freq.dist around zero.
# Note: The alignment of the fd-bin borders is done automatically.
#       It is not possible, do have a class boundary exactly
#       at say 273.15 with class-width of 1.

# Section: HLEV
# -------------
# Please, note that this was not tested for a rather long time.

# The Hans-Luthardt-Extreme-Value-Detection (see code in qcExecutor).
# The HL extreme value is expressed as deviation range normalised to
# the units of standard deviation: (max-min)/stdDev,
# i.e. is dimensionless for each grid-cell.
# If a threshold is exceeded, then by default, a notification
# is written to the SESSION_LOG.
# Makes not really sense for applying to 3D.
# Derived by and therefore requires CDO.
# HLEVD  # [disabled]

# Delete netCDF file with HLEV in any case;
# only notification takes place.
# HLEVD_DELETE_FILE  # [disabled]

# To detrend a time series takes some time.
# If a trend of a variable does not boost exponentially
# detrending should not affect this kind of extreme value
# detection (which is anyway rather vague).
# HLEVD_DETREND  # [disabled]

# Keep netCDF file with HLEV if threshold was exceeded.
# HLEVD_KEEP_THRESHOLD_FILE  # [disabled]

# Keep netCDF file with HLEV exceeding threshold.
# HLEVD_KEEP_THRESHOLD_FILE  # [disabled]

# Threshold: (max-min)/stdDev > threshold
# HLEVD_THRESHOLD=9  # [ 1 ]


# Section: Syntax Rules of the Configuration File
# -----------------------------------------------
# KEY WORDS controlling the application in the quality-control-run.
# SYNTAX: KEY-WORD[[+][=]value[,value[,value]]
#

# -) KEY-WORD
#    Consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscore;
#    only upper-case with alphabetic begin. KEY_WORD and following
#    '=' or '+=' may be separated by spaces.
# -) KEY-WORD
#    Set alone enables a corresponding feature. Equivalent to KEY-WORD=t .
# -) KEY-WORD=value
#    Make a simple assignment; any previous assignment is overwritten;
#    also by KEY-WORD alone.
# -) KEY-WORD=value1,value2, ...
#    Assign a comma-separated-expression. This will be expanded to an array.
# -) KEY-WORD+=value
# -) Add another item to a comma-separated expression.
# -) Configuration options may be supplied on the command line with the prefix -E_.
# -) Options SELECT and LOCK are special.
#    Additionally, -S param and -L param may be given alternatively
#    on the command-line.
# -) Invalid/misspelled KEY_WORD is discarded without notice;
#    this may cause 'amazement'.
#    The effect of invalid assignments is trapped sometimes.

# Note for SELECT, LOCK, -S and -L usage:
# General setting:  {space, = ,+=}[path[=]][variable]

# Examples:
# leading character(s) supplied by the calling instances
# -) '=': define or overwrite
# -) '+=': prolong array of paths/variables
# -) no leading '=' character: equivalent to +=

# -) path=var
#    specifies a single path where to look for a single variable
# -) p1,p2=var
#    two paths to look for a variable
# -) p1,p2=
#    two paths with every variable, equivalent to p1,p2=.*
# -) p1=v1,v2
#    one path with two variables
# -) str1[,str2,str3]
#    a) no '/' --> variables
#    b) '/' anywhwere  --> only paths; no trapping of errors
# -) relative path without a '/' must have '=' appended
# -) p1=,p2=v1...  --> ERROR
